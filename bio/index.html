<div class="col-lg-12">
          <p class="lead">My chinese name is Wang Wei, and I also go with Hunter. I grew up in Nanjing, China and came to the States for undergrad at Emory University. I later transferred to Georgia Tech through the 3-2 program to pursue a degree in computer science.
 My study focus is on distributed computing but recently, I also get interested in machine learning. I am looking for opportunities to build high performace platform for machine learning.
I like sports a lot. My favourite sport is soccer and the team I support is Barcelona. Also I am a e-sport lover and I am a DOTA2 player. Finally, I am an anime lover. My favourite character is chitanda eru.</p>
